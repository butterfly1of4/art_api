# Harvard Art Search API


This application allows you to look through the works included in the libraries affiliated with Harvard. These inclue the Fogg Museum, Busch-Reisinger Museum and Arthur M. Sackler Museum.  


# **Installation and Dependencies**
The dependencies needed to run this API are; 
    -NPM (Node)
    -Mongoose
    -MongoDB
    -Express
All of them need to be installed and up to date. Use npm to install the other 3. This install will require a knowledge of Node and JavaScript. All of this was done on MacOS, so other interfaces may be different. Built on VSC Code using javascript along with NPM to manage dependencies and istall, Mongoose to interface with the database, MongoDB to create a database, and Express to act as the webserver. 

# **Use and Navigation**
To open this, open your browser to localhost:3000/record. Chrome was used to build this webpage. This should give you a list of the works contained in the API. If you're looking for a specific entry, search by _id/<enter number here>. Entries can be updated and deleted using the same _id number. Currently, this app will allow for basic search of the database, however increased functionality (more search options) should be included at a later time.
